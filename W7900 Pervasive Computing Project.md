## xformers
We need to compile from code
```
# Make sure we have the ROCm version of PyTorch
pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm6.0

# You can double check
python -c "import torch; print(torch.version.hip)"

# Install from source - on a Ryzen 5600G takes ~
pip install ninja
pip install -v -U git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers.git@main#egg=xformers

# Double check
python -m xformers.info


```
