Welcome to `llm-tracker.info`. This is a personal site [I](https://leonardlin.com/) started to keep my notes focused around Large Language Models and Generative AI.
- If you are looking for a pure list of open LLMs, check out [Extractum's LLM Explorer](https://llm.extractum.io/) (it's sortable/filterable! Here's a view of the [current top of the (heavily gamed) HuggingFace LLM Leaderboard](https://llm.extractum.io/list/?lbonly) for example - for better leaderboards, see [[List of Evals]])
- Eugene Yan and others maintain a list of [Open LLMs](https://github.com/eugeneyan/open-llms) (restricted to commercial use licensed models).
- I also keep an LLM Worksheet that includes a [less-maintained list of Foundational models](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kT4or6b0Fedd-W_jMwYpb63e1ZR3aePczz3zlbJW-Y4/edit#gid=741531996), but includes a bunch of raw [inferencing benchmarks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kT4or6b0Fedd-W_jMwYpb63e1ZR3aePczz3zlbJW-Y4/edit#gid=1788227831) and other information hidden in there...

While I've been steadily adding/updating a lot of these docs, they are mostly working notes and are not particularly well organized. There's also other similar notebooks/guides. Check out:
* https://genai-handbook.github.io/ - a 2024-06 notebook aiming to give a good GenAI technical overview (aimed at those with a strong technical background)
* https://github.com/mlabonne/llm-course - [Maxime Labonne](https://huggingface.co/mlabonne)'s practical guide for fine-tuning, testing LLMs and the like
* https://fleuret.org/francois/lbdl.html - "This book is a short introduction to deep learning for readers with a STEM background, originally designed to be read on a phone screen."
* https://github.com/stas00/ml-engineering - "This is an open collection of methodologies, tools and step by step instructions to help with successful training of large language models and multi-modal models."

In 2024 a lot more of my time has gone into training Japanese AI models and in a  co-founding a Japanese AI startup, [Shisa.AI](https://shisa.ai/).
* https://huggingface.co/augmxnt/shisa-7b-v1 - original release of leading-edge open Japanese LLM
* https://github.com/AUGMXNT/shisa/wiki/ - a lot of related docs
* https://huggingface.co/shisa-ai and https://github.com/shisa-ai/ are where the new work is ongoing
* I've also started publishing some articles on my HF page: https://huggingface.co/leonardlin

## Popular Content
Eventually I plan to make a custom Quartz component for recently updated, new, and popular content, but for now a few places to start:
- [[Getting Started]] - a good starting point if you're new to the world of LLMs
- [[StyleTTS 2 Setup Guide]] - this seems to show it in searches
- [[AMD GPUs]] - an up-to-date guide on getting ROCm set up for inferencing and updated performance tests
- [[Qwen Fine Tune]] - a guide on Qwen fine-tuning, trying out a number of training scripts.
