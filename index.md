Welcome to `llm-tracker.info`. This site aims keep notes focused around Large Language Models and Generative AI.
- If you are looking for a pure list of open LLMs, check out [Extractum's LLM Explorer](https://llm.extractum.io/) (it's sortable/filterable! Here's a view of the [current top of the (heavily gamed) HuggingFace LLM Leaderboard](https://llm.extractum.io/list/lm.extractum.io/list/tum.io/list//list/) for example)
- Eugene Yan and other maintain a list of [Open LLMs](https://github.com/eugeneyan/open-llms) (restricted to commercial use licensed models).
- I also keep an LLM Worksheet that includes a [less-maintained list of Foundational models](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kT4or6b0Fedd-W_jMwYpb63e1ZR3aePczz3zlbJW-Y4/edit#gid=741531996), but includes a bunch of raw [inferencing benchmarks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kT4or6b0Fedd-W_jMwYpb63e1ZR3aePczz3zlbJW-Y4/edit#gid=1788227831) and other information hidden in there...
## Popular Content
This section is temporary (we'll make custom Quartz components for recently updated, new, and popular content soon), but for now a few places to start:
- [[Getting Started]] - a good starting point if you're new to the world of LLMs
- [[StyleTTS 2 Setup Guide]] - this seems to show it in searches
- [[AMD GPUs]] - an up-to-date guide on getting ROCm set up for inferencing and updated performance tests
- [[Qwen Fine Tune]] - a guide on Qwen fine-tuning, trying out a number of training scripts.
# Updates
## 2023-01-09
We've just flipped the switch to move from BookStack to Quartz for publishing. While there's some ongoing construction, all the old content should be redirected/ported over to the new version.
