For best price/perf, Dual Socket EPYC ROME is probably the way to go.

If you have the cash:
- Cheap dual core 9004 chips. The going rate for a 9334 QS/ES chip is $600 atm, so you could get a pair for $1200 and should give you about 400GB/s
- For dual socket you're probably looking at a Gigabyte MZ73-LM1 or AsRock Rack TURIN2D16-2T - looks like those aren't going for about $1000-1300
- It's about $1500-1800 for 384GB (24x16GB or 12x32GB DDR5-4800 ECC); 30% more for DDR5-5600 but maybe worth it if you're going to drop in a 9005 upgrade at some point
- $250 for a 6U "mining" GPU server case (AliExpress), should be able to easily fit 4 GPUs on risers (not an issue for inferencing) - say $200 for good quality risers
- $400 for a good 1300-1500W power supply

Either way you'll want GPUs, depending on your price:


| GPU | Memory | MBW | FP16 TFLOPS |
| --- | ------ | --- | ----------- |
|     |        |     |             |


- 96GB
	- $8000 - RTX Pro 6000
	- 
- $2500 - 5090 32GB


- I would only recommend AMD MI100 32GB for <$1000 and if you feel confident in your ability to fight w/ software and know you don't need CUDA
