# Client
The current version of the API is quite picky and I couldn't find anything compatible... here's a simple client that ChatGPT-4 CI helped me write:

```
import requests
import json

SYSTEM_PROMPT = 'A chat with a helpful assistant.'

HOST = 'http://127.0.0.1:7777'
MODEL = 'meta-llama_Llama-2-7b-hf' 
MAX_CONTEXT = 4096

def send_request(messages):
    url = f'{HOST}/v1/chat/completions'
    headers = {'content-type': 'application/json'}
    payload = {
        'model': MODEL,
        'temperature': 0.7,
        'max_tokens': 2048,
        'messages': messages
    }


    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

def get_assistant_reply(response):
    return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']

def interactive_chat():
    messages = [{"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT}]
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})
        response = send_request(messages)
        print(response)
        assistant_reply = get_assistant_reply(response)
        messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": assistant_reply})
        print("Assistant:", assistant_reply)
        if user_input.lower() == 'exit':
            break

interactive_chat()
```
* This is a super simple client, you'd want to add token counting and message log truncation if you were going to use it seriously
* For me on a fast system (NVMe SSD, 5950X, 4090), takes 2-3min to load, maybe shortened w/ bitsandbytes...
* The routing works but obvious not well, it's just a POC and could be improved tremendously
* llama2-7b is dumb as a box of rocks, lol

To test the routing, I recommend some simple queries like:
```
# function/code
Write me Python "hello world" FastAPI script.

# creative
Write me a haiku.

# reasoning
There are two ducks in front of a duck, two ducks behind a duck and a duck in the middle. How many ducks are there?

Part of these were bugs that I reported and got stamped out:
* `/v1/models` endpoint bug
* CORS errors
